h1. Redis Lua Stats Recipes

Some basic recipes to get you started with the Redis scripting branch.

Feel free to fork and edit or add your own :)

To run these checkout the latest scripting branch of Redis, compile and kick off the server. Then do:

@redis-cli eval "$(cat <path to script>)" 1 <key of existing list>@

NB: This is my first experience with Lua so be gentle :P
